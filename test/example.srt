1
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,083
How did you sleep?

2
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,085
Well.

3
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,216
Apparently, we’re
getting new neighbours soon, too.

4
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,635
Yeah?

5
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,345
Yeah.

6
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,601
When’s your train going?

7
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,354
As usual?

8
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,648
Yes.

9
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,816
At 10.

10
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,360
As every monday.

11
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:00,878
.

12
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,469
I had a dream.

13
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,972
Want to hear it?

14
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,268
With friends I entered an old warehouse.

15
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,276
White lamps illuminated 
a room of white tiles and walls 

16
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,444
which yet were dirty.

17
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,654
There also stood a shelf

18
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,408
with things on it
which I did not understand.

19
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,119
We attempted to have ourselves frozen

20
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,788
to get unfrozen again in the future.

21
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,583
Having arrived I learned…

22
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,258
Having arrived I learned 
that we were not to choose

23
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,468
when precisely.

24
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,888
Not even getting unfrozen together

25
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,598
was ours to decide.

26
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,936
I had it done anyways. 

27
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,274
After all, it was already paid for.

28
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:57,620
.

29
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,580
And how are you?

30
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,166
So-so.

31
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
I’m almost done with preparation.

32
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,672
But it's not that important.

33
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,300
I’m starting to get a bit nervous.

34
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,179
But I’m also happy
because the day is coming closer.

35
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,598
And now,

36
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,309
with all the others
supposedly coming to us...

37
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,816
I mean I always wanted to see New Zealand.

38
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,110
And I’m also coming back, I guess.

39
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,163
Before I forget:

40
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,630
When my brother was here

41
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,342
he gave me a card.

42
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,017
You can keep it if you want.

43
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,065
Think of me when looking at it.

44
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,407
Before I leave
we will definitely do something together.

45
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,451
I promise.

46
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:18,511
.

47
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,388
What's new?

48
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,890
Some of them have bitten my mother.

49
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,684
It was quite horrible.

50
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,103
My father and I cried.

51
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,480
It all went very fast,
I mean:

52
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,439
her transformation.

53
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,860
At first her wound
swelled red and mother stopped speaking.

54
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,573
Her gums turned black
and she stopped washing herself.

55
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,994
After a while she sat down
on the chair and stopped moving.

56
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,416
The neighbours already started gossiping,
why one did not see her anymore

57
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,627
and why the shutters
on our living room were always let down.

58
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,005
When a neighbour’s boy
tried to press the shutters upwards 

59
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,133
we had to move her into the cellar.

60
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,886
At that time her body
was already covered with ulcerous bumps.
<i><b><u><font color=#00000000></font></u></b></i>
<i><b><u><font color=#00000000></font></u></b></i>

61
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:42,744
.

62
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,038
That is that.

63
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,372
.

64
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,958
Whenever I could,

65
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,293
I went my way.

66
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,464
It led from my desk

67
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,591
through the village,

68
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,719
on convoluted paths

69
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
and far meadows

70
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,806
on to a hidden place.

71
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:51,229
Every evening this travel was possible

72
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,899
turned the day into a successful one.

73
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,071
I knew that no one
would cross my paths there

74
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,115
and that I could feel at home.

75
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,493
Alone I was,

76
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,622
gazing in amazement
at the magnitude of the setting sun –

77
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:15,253
yet feeling in company
with the greatest men in history.

78
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,423
Nothing could be compared to this feeling,

79
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,886
to enter an alliance with these very few

80
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,849
in the encounter
with the visage of the sun.

81
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,009
.

82
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:45,802
.

83
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,762
Give it to me!

84
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,981
Have you heard about the new ones?

85
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,069
Which new ones?

86
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,365
Now some are 
supposed to be also coming here, to us.

87
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,534
Oh, ok.

88
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,456
The clock has stopped.

89
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,836
Oh, I will make it run again then.

90
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,338
How much did that cost?

91
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,798
50.

92
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:36,603
.

93
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,608
What do you expect from life?

94
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,861
Nothing,I’ll let myself get surprised.

95
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,155
For now I’ll expect something to eat.

96
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,912
<i>…modern technologies</i>
<i>and insights with them into the new world.</i>

97
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,123
<i>But it were</i>
<i>the Chinese who built the railways </i>

98
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,168
<i>and so robbed</i>
<i>the Indians of their spiritual lifestyle…</i>

99
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,127
Do you need much longer?

100
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,128
…in unity with nature…

101
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,129
Turn off the sound!

102
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,716
<i>…nowadays they live in reservations,</i>
<i>in bars and in front of casinos.</i>

103
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:03,231
Look at what your girlfriend sent to me.

104
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,441
Look at what your girlfriend sent to me.

105
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,777
Yeah, she turned really strange.

106
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:23,978
Turn off the lights, you're luring the gnats!

107
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,021
Turn off the lights,

108
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,314
you're luring the gnats!

109
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,157
Although we are becoming older than ever, our time becomes ever shorter.

110
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,992
<i>Although we are becoming older than ever,</i>

111
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,328
<i>our time becomes ever shorter.</i>

112
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,914
<i>Although the world seems ever smaller,</i>

113
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,874
<i>it becomes ever more confusing.</i>

114
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,086
<i>Although we are gaining ever more insights</i>

115
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,714
<i>…the unknown threatens ever </i>
<i>more pervasively.</i>
- Did you mow the lawn?

116
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,967
<i>What can one do about that?</i>
- Yes.

117
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,388
<i>We have asked professor doctor Kruse.</i>
- Did you have a good time
with your friends?

118
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,724
<i>In spite of all dangers there is</i>
<i>no reason to be afraid.</i>
- Yes.

119
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,894
<i>…by taking preventive measures.</i>
- When's your train going?

120
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,104
<i>Going to bed early,...</i>

121
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,358
<i>…a balanced diet and thinking positively</i>
<i>do wonders there.</i>
- At 10...

122
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,234
...as every Tuesday.

123
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,695
<i>Yoga and meditation are also recommended.</i>

124
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,575
<i>Which of the diverse options one finally</i>
<i>uses is a matter of taste, naturally.</i>
- Do you need any money?

125
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,953
<i>Where do you want to</i>
<i>be when the end is nigh?</i>

126
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,707
<i>Where do you want to</i>
<i>be when the other is nigh?</i>

127
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,001
<i>Depression or inner peace?</i>

128
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,878
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

129
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:30,761
Ah.

130
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,263
Ah.

131
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,056
It's you.
